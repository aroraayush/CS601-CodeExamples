Problem 7
Why using a read/write lock might be preferable over using synchronized methods or blocks when reading and writing data?

    We can have multiple readers reading concurrently (as long as no writer is writing).
    No blocking if only read operation has to performed. (as long as no writer is writing).


Problem 8
What is the difference between interfaces Iterable and Iterator? What methods does each of these interfaces have?
    Iterable means its contents can be iterated over (using an Iterator).
    Iterable has only one method "iterator()".

    Iterator is a smart "bookmark", has methods hasNext() and next() (and often "remove").


Problem 9
Assume that Movable is an interface, and that class Alien implements Movable.  Which of the statements below are valid?  (select all that are true)

A. Movable m = new Movable();   NOT OK (cannot create an instance of interface)

B. Movable ma = new Alien(); OK

C. Alien a = new Movable(); NOT OK; Cannot create an instance of an interface (Movable in this example)

D. Object o = new Alien(); OK (Upcasting)
